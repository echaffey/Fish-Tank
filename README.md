# Fish-Tank
CSC final project [2013]

On load, there will be three fish loaded into the tank by default.  To add another fish, simply click the add button below the image of the type of fish that you wish to add. Over time, each fish will begin to lose health.  This can be seen on the right hand side of the screen in the list of tiles.  Each tile contains the name of the fish, a health bar, and the percentage of health that they have.  In order for each fish to regain health, you must feed them by clicking the button below the image of the fish food container.
